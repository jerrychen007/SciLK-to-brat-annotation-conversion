3-Isobutyl-5-methyl-1-(oxetan-2-ylmethyl)-6-[(2-oxoimidazolidin-1-yl)methyl]thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (racemate)
813 mg (1.84 mmol) of the compound from Example 243A were dissolved in 40 ml of dioxane, and 461 mg (2.76 mmol) of CDI were added.
The mixture was stirred at RT for 16 h.
The reaction solution was then concentrated on a rotary evaporator.
The residue was dissolved in 15 ml of DMSO and this solution was purified by means of preparative HPLC (Method 14).
Combination of the product fractions and freeze-drying gave 383 mg (42% of theory) of the title compound
16.8: [5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid
2.3 ml (2.3 mmol) of a 1N aqueous solution of lithium hydroxide is added to a solution of 475 mg (1.5 mmol) of [5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-methyl acetate in 15 ml of tetrahydrofuran and 3 mL of water.
The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 hours, and then adjusted to pH6 by adding 4 ml of 1N aqueous solution of acetic acid.
The product is extracted with ethyl acetate.
The organic phase is washed with water and then with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum.
400 mg (88%) of [5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid is obtained in the form of a white solid.
[Step 3] Synthesis of N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-N-(2-fluoro-4-(hydrazinecarbonyl)benzyl)tetrahydro-2H-thiopyran-4-carboxamide 1,1-dioxide
Methyl 4-((N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-1,1-dioxidotetrahydro-2H-thiopyran-4-carboxamido)methyl)-3-fluorobenzoate (1.240 g, 2.628 mmol), synthesized in step 2, and hydrazine monohydrate (2.554 mL, 52.554 mmol) were dissolved in ethanol (20 mL)/water (5 mL) at room temperature, and the solution was stirred at 80 degrees C for 5 hours, and then cooled to room temperature to terminate the reaction.
The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the solvent.
The title compound was used without further purification (1.180 g, 95.2%) as yellow solid.
Example 51-5 : Preparation of 2'-amino-6-(2-amino-6-morpholinopyrimidin-4-yl)-3'-fluoro-[2,4'-bipyridin]-5-ol (LXXVI)
6-(2-Amino-6-morpholinopyrimidin-4-yl)-3'-fluoro-5-methoxy-[2,4'-bipyridin]-2'-amine (120 mg, 301.95 micro mol) and pyridine hydrochloride (Pyridine HCl) (523.41 mg, 4.53 mmol) were stirred in a sealed tube at 170 degrees C for 30 min.
The resulting mixture was cooled to room temperature, neutralized with 2 N NaOH solution to provide a solid.
The solid was filtered, washed with diethylether and dried to give the title compound (72 mg, 62 %).
Step 2: 8-Chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-((2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methoxy)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one
To a solution of 2-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-8-chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-((2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methoxy)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one (2.9 g, 4.83 mmol) in THF (20 ml) was added a 1 M solution of TBAF in THF (7.25 ml, 7.25 mmol) at 0 degrees C.
The reaction was stirred at 0 degrees C. for 1 hour.
It was quenched with water and diluted in EtOAc.
The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc.
The combined organic layer was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure.
The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (10-100% EtOAc in heptane) to give the title compound (1.74 g, 74% yield).
Step 2: (R)-tert-Butyl (2-(8-(benzyloxy)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)-2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)ethyl)((1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl)carbamate
A stirred solution of (R)-8-(benzyloxy)-5-(2-(((1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl)amino)-1-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)ethyl)quinolin-2(1H)-one (2.65 g, 4.33 mmol) in DCM (25 mL) was added with a solution of di-tert-butyldicarbonate (1.13 g, 5.18 mmol) in DCM (5 mL).
The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours.
The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue purified by flash column chromatography (eluent-100% DCM to 30:1 DCM/7M NH3/MeOH) to afford the title compound (2.83 g, 92%).
